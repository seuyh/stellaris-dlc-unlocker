## Description

Stellaris DLC Unlocker is a program designed to simplify the process of unlocking DLC (Downloadable Content) for the game Stellaris. It allows users to unlock all DLC for FREE and AUTOMATICALLY. Thanks to auto-updates and the ability to download files from the server, the program does not need to be re-downloaded every time new versions of the game and DLC are released. Once downloaded, the program will automatically load the necessary files.

#### What this will save you from:
- Steam connection error
- Authenticity check error for DLC in the launcher
- Launcher crashes
- Game's inability to detect DLC
- Need to figure out anything

## How to Use

1. **Download the latest release from the current [repository](https://github.com/seuyh/stellaris-dlc-unlocker/releases).**

2. **Close the game and the Paradox launcher:**

3. **Open the Stellaris DLC Unlocker program and follow the installer instructions on your device.**

4. **Done! All DLCs are now unlocked and ready to use in the game Stellaris!**

## Requirements

- Steam License: Stellaris
- Operating System: Tested on Windows 10/11. Compatibility with earlier versions is not ruled out.
- Internet access
- Approximately 2GB of free disk space
- Ability to read text on the screen

## Known Issues

- Download hangs at "x" percent. This means what the server stopped responding. Restart the program and preferably wait for some time before restarting.
  
- Antivirus complains/removes the application. I've done everything possible to prevent this, but for some reason, in rare cases, Windows Defender starts to complain or may even delete the file after restarting the computer without saying anything to you.

- Multiplayer does not work. Enabling cross-platform mode in the game launcher helps.
